      <!-- Project Title -->
      <h1>The ITAC Operations & Client Portal</h1>

      <!-- High-level Overview -->
      <section class="case-study-overview-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="case-study-overview">
          The goal is to replace a fragmented, email-reliant workflow with a controlled, trackable, and traceable system through automation. This unified web portal for OSU's ITAC will manage the entire client assessment lifecycle, eliminate process bottlenecks, and provide a single source of truth for all project stakeholders (internal staff, management, students, and external clients).
        </p>
        
        <!-- Project Roles & Details -->
        <p>
          <strong>My Role:</strong> UX Designer (End-to-End). I conducted the entire design process, from user research and ideation to wireframing and prototyping.<br>
          <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Conducting user research, defining user journeys, wireframing and prototyping, and developing the full-stack web application, including integrated AI agents.<br>

      <!-- The Problem -->
      <section>
        <h2>The Problem: Understanding the User</h2>
        <p>
          The primary research was a detailed, semi-structured interview with a key ITAC staff member who manages the client pipeline. The interview revealed that the current process is almost entirely manual, leading to significant inefficiencies and a lack of visibility.
        </p>
        <p>This uncovered four major pain points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Centralized Visibility:</strong> There is no mechanism for management or staff to see the client backlog or project statuses. Staff must keep manual lists, creating confusion and communication gaps.</li>
          <li><strong>"Clumsy and Clunky" Onboarding:</strong> The initial client interaction involves a multi-step email process with 3-4 attachments, which is inefficient and difficult to track.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of Client Status Tracking:</strong> ITAC has no systematic way of tracking which clients have submitted documents, what's missing, or when to follow up, causing potential projects to languish.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Delays Cause Bottlenecks:</strong> On-site audits are started before all utility data is collected. This forces students writing the report to chase down data later, stretching a 5-day task into 15 days and jeopardizing deadlines.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Personas -->
      <section>
        <h3>Persona: "Jack" the Program Coordinator</h3>
        <p>Based on the research, I created a persona to represent the primary staff user, "Jack."</p>
        <p class="case-study-overview" style="font-size: var(--font-size-medium-1); line-height: 1.4;">
          "I started doing this [keeping a list] and it was too much... I'm having to keep it in a separate file somewhere."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Jack is a busy project coordinator who needs a centralized and automated system to manage the client pipeline because the current manual, email-based process makes it impossible to track client statuses effectively, leading to project delays and a significant administrative burden.
        </p>

      <!-- User Journey Map -->
      <section>
        <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
        <p>Jack's journey for onboarding a new client is defined by manual tasks, context-switching, and a lack of automated support. I mapped this process to find clear opportunities for improvement.</p>

        <p><strong>Improvement Opportunities Identified:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A single intake form to auto-create projects.</li>
          <li>An automated welcome email with a link to a personalized client dashboard.</li>
          <li>Auto-generated digital folder structures.</li>
          <li>A real-time dashboard showing document status for every client.</li>
          <li>System-generated reminder emails for clients with incomplete documents.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- The Process & Solution -->
      <section>
        <h2>Starting the Design</h2>
        
        <h3>Paper Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          I started with paper and pencil to quickly explore layouts and information hierarchies. This allowed me to focus on the core structure, exploring both a comprehensive client and staff dashboard. My initial sketches helped establish a cohesive flow, starting with a login that leads to respective dashboards.
        </p>

        <h3>Digital Wireframes & Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          My digital wireframes translated these solutions into a clear, functional blueprint.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Staff Dashboard & Kanban Board:</strong> This is the central command center. It directly addresses the "No centralized visibility" pain point by providing a single, "at-a-glance" visual pipeline of all client projects (New Inquiry, Awaiting Documents, Audit Scheduled, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Client Dashboard:</strong> This is the client's home base, designed for clarity. A prominent visual status tracker solves the "Lack of client status tracking" and provides transparency.</li>
          <li><strong>"Uploaded Documents" Screen:</strong> This replaces the "clumsy onboarding" process. A simple checklist with upload buttons ensures all data is received in one organized place before an audit is scheduled, fixing the "Data delays" bottleneck.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usability Study: Round 1 Findings</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted a design review and usability study with the key ITAC staff member. This study was incredibly valuable and uncovered a major gap in the initial design, leading to a significant pivot.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Critical Discovery:</strong> The design was missing a critical, upfront vetting process *before* a client is approved for document submission.</li>
          <li><strong>Functional Gap:</strong> The original design did not account for different service types (ITAC - Industrial, ITAC - Commercial, REAC), which is the first decision the staff makes.</li>
          <li><strong>Workflow Invalidated:</strong> The assumption of a single client flow was incorrect. The portal needed a new two-phase onboarding process to separate "vetting" from "assessment."</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Updated Architecture & Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the findings, I re-architected the flow to include the new two-phase vetting process. This introduced a "Client Temporary Dashboard" for initial data collection and a "Staff - Client Review Page" to manage the new approval step.

        <h3>Usability Study: Round 2 Findings</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted a design review and usability study with the key ITAC staff members and director. This study was incredibly valuable and uncovered some issues and painpoints.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Insufficient Logo's:</strong> The design was missing some logo's, the director wants to represent the brand by logo's</li>
          <li><strong>Color mismatching:</strong> The original design doesn't have the color accuracy to the branding of the company, so I have created design systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Text errors:</strong> The design have some unwanted text's and font of the text is different from page to page which made user uncertain, so I have selected a sandard font</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Site Map</h3>
        <p>
          After the usability studies, I designed site maps for both staff and client seperately.

      <!-- Refining the Design -->
      <section>
        <h2>Refining the Design</h2>
        <p>By considering all the finding's from usability studies, I made high-fidelity prototype</p>
        <h3>Solutions for findings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Created a standard design system with standard UI Elements, Guidelines.</li>
          <li>Added a lot of logo's and redesigned accordingly.</li>
          <li>Added new features and made it simple for better understanding.</li>
        </ol> 

        <h3>Accessibility Considerations</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Designed with clear color contrast for text and UI elements to meet WCAG AA standards.</li>
          <li>Ensured all interactive elements have clear focus states for keyboard navigation.</li>
          <li>Used clear, hierarchical headings and ARIA labels for screen reader accessibility.</li>
        </ol>

      <!-- Conclusion / What I Learned -->
      <section>
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Impact:</strong> The new design, once implemented, is projected to automate the entire client onboarding process, saving staff an estimated 5-8 hours per week in manual data entry and follow-up emails.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What I learned:</strong> This ongoing project is a massive lesson in balancing the needs of multiple, diverse user groups. The "Client" needs extreme simplicity, while the "Staff" needs powerful, complex tools. The biggest challenge is designing a single system that serves both without compromise. Building the front-end directly from my own designs has also been incredibly efficient, allowing me to spot and fix usability issues during development that I might have missed in a static prototype.
